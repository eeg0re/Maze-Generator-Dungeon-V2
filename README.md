This project acts as a proof of concept for a randomly generated maze-based dungeon crawler. It is very incomplete,
but the idea is there. 

with the downloaded files, you can play the experimental project using the WASD keys on your keyboard to move, and 
left-click to swing your sword (also use left joystick and right trigger on a gamepad).
